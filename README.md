# TODO - add instructions

* Set an env var with your opeai api key: OPENAI_API_KEY
* create a "data" folder
* put all your data files in data (text files, maybe also pdfs and word docs, not sure)
* run llama-index-powered-chat.py

* NOTE: read-all-terms.py just downloads the open ai terms and conditions to use, you don't need to run it, bring your own data
